# Digital Fusion Roots (DFR)

A **Digital Fusion Root (DFR)** is a number that is equal to the **concatenation** of its digit sum and digit product.  
This repository contains Python code to identify, verify, and analyze such numbers.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Digit Sum** – Add all digits of a number.  
2. **Digit Product** – Multiply all digits of a number.  
3. **Concatenation** – Join the digit sum and digit product as strings.  
4. **Check** – If the concatenated value equals the original number, it’s a DFR.
